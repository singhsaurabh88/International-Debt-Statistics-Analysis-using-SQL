# International Debt Statistics Analysis

This project analyzes the debt owed by countries to the World Bank using SQL. The goal is to explore how much money countries owe to the World Bank and perform various types of analysis, including calculating the total debt, identifying the countries with the highest debt, and exploring the mean debt across different regions and debt indicators.

## Project Description

The dataset is provided by the World Bank and contains information on international debts (in USD) for different countries. By leveraging SQL, this project performs the following analyses:

1. Total amount of debt owed by countries.
2. Identifying the country with the highest debt.
3. Calculating the mean debt for different debt indicators.
4. Analyzing global debt trends.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to understand and analyze how debt varies across countries and time. It involves applying various SQL queries to manipulate and extract insights from the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset can be found on the World Bank website:

[World Bank Debt Dataset](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home)

## Technologies Used
